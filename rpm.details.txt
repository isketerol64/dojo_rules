Summary     : An XML parser library
Description :
This is expat, the C library for parsing XML, written by James Clark. Expat
is a stream oriented XML parser. This means that you register handlers with
the parser prior to starting the parse. These handlers are called when the
parser discovers the associated structures in the document being parsed. A
start tag is an example of the kind of structures for which you may
register handlers.

The library is available as 32-bit and 64-bit.

Summary     : GNU libraries and utilities for producing multi-lingual messages.
Description :
The GNU gettext package provides a set of tools and documentation for
producing multi-lingual messages in programs. Tools include a set of
conventions about how programs should be written to support message
catalogs, a directory and file naming organization for the message
catalogs, a runtime library which supports the retrieval of translated
messages, and stand-alone programs for handling the translatable and
the already translated strings. Gettext provides an easy to use
library and tools for creating, using, and modifying natural language
catalogs and is a powerful and simple method for internationalizing
programs.

The library is available as 32-bit and 64-bit.

Summary     : A file compression utility
Description :
Bzip2 is a freely available, patent-free, high quality data compressor.
Bzip2 compresses files to within 10 to 15 percent of the capabilities
of the best techniques available.  However, bzip2 has the added benefit
of being approximately two times faster at compression and six times
faster at decompression than those techniques.  Bzip2 is not the
fastest compression utility, but it does strike a balance between speed
and compression capability.

Install bzip2 if you need a compression utility.

The library is available as 32-bit and 64-bit.

Summary     : A GNU arbitrary precision library
Description :
The gmp package contains GNU MP, a library for arbitrary precision
arithmetic, signed integers operations, rational numbers and floating
point numbers. GNU MP is designed for speed, for both small and very
large operands. GNU MP is fast because it uses fullwords as the basic
arithmetic type, it uses fast algorithms, it carefully optimizes
assembly code for many CPUs' most common inner loops, and it generally
emphasizes speed over simplicity/elegance in its operations.

Install the gmp package if you need a fast arbitrary precision
library.

The library is available as 32-bit and 64-bit.

Summary     : A portable foreign function interface library
Description :
Compilers for high level languages generate code that follow certain
conventions.  These conventions are necessary, in part, for separate
compilation to work.  One such convention is the "calling convention".
The calling convention is a set of assumptions made by the compiler
about where function arguments will be found on entry to a function.
A calling convention also specifies where the return value for a function
is found.

Some programs may not know at the time of compilation what arguments
are to be passed to a function.  For instance, an interpreter may be
told at run-time about the number and types of arguments used to call a
given function.  `Libffi' can be used in such programs to provide a
bridge from the interpreter program to compiled code.

The `libffi' library provides a portable, high level programming
interface to various calling conventions.  This allows a programmer to
call any function specified by a call interface description at run time.

FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface.  A foreign function
interface is the popular name for the interface that allows code
written in one language to call code written in another language.
The `libffi' library really only provides the lowest, machine dependent
layer of a fully featured foreign function interface.  A layer must
exist above `libffi' that handles type conversions for values passed
between the two languages.

administer an SQLite database and which serves as an example of how to
use the SQLite library.

The library is available as 32-bit and 64-bit.

Summary     : An interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language.
Description :
Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
language often compared to Tcl, Perl, Scheme or Java. Python includes
modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types and
dynamic typing. Python supports interfaces to many system calls and
libraries, as well as to various windowing systems (X11, Motif, Tk,
Mac and MFC).

Programmers can write new built-in modules for Python in C or C++.
Python can be used as an extension language for applications that need
a programmable interface. This package contains most of the standard
Python modules, as well as modules for interfacing to the Tix widget
set for Tk and RPM.

Note that documentation for Python is provided in the python-docs
package.

Summary     : A program for synchronizing files over a network.
Description :
Rsync uses a reliable algorithm to bring remote and host files into
sync very quickly. Rsync is fast because it just sends the differences
in the files over the network instead of sending the complete
files. Rsync is often used as a very powerful mirroring process or
just as a more capable replacement for the rcp command. A technical
report which describes the rsync algorithm is included in this
package.

Summary     : A text file browser similar to more, but better
Description :
Less is a pager. A pager is a program that displays text files. Other
pagers commonly in use are more and pg. Pagers are often used in
command-line environments like the Unix shell and the MS-DOS command
prompt to display files. Windowed environments like the Windows and
Macintosh desktops don't need pagers as much, since they have other
methods for viewing files.

Less is not an editor. You can't change the contents of the file you're
viewing. Less is not a windowing system. It doesn't have fancy scroll
bars or other GUI (graphical user interface) elements. It was designed
to work on simple text-only terminals.

unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations
and full access to internals.
